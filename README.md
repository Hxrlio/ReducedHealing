## Goal?
Minecraft's healing system has undergone an array of changes since its inception. In beta, your health capacity was dictated by nothing but the size of your inventory. The player was nigh on unkillable if they wanted to be, while being encouraged to be as weak as possible. This balancing act was interesting, but ultimately the player's potency was too high. Then came hunger. Now the player was a lot weaker in the healing department - a welcome change - but it came alongside many changes that strengthened the player, most notably in the form of sprinting. Now food based regeneration can't protect the player in combat, but will suffice to top them up for the next fight, and healing items are introduced to serve the player's in-combat needs. But the recovery period after a fight is one most player's will spend idly, and spending that much time idle leads to a frustrating user experience. So in 1.9 natural healing got an initial 'burst'. This is great for getting back into the action, but has the slight oversight that the player has once again become unkillable, but now with a much wider arsenal at their disposal, and at no inventory cost. Finally, the totem of undying was introduced, a really cool item that unfortunately put the nail in the coffin of minecraft difficulty.

This mod's purpose is to overturn some of the downgrades this game has received. You will find many mods that achieve this by stating "this update bad" and thanos snapping it out of existence. My goal is to take a more nuanced approach that allows for the good to be isolated from the bad, as these negatively received changes are mixed bags.

First, natural burst healing must only function outside of combat. This is a great boon for the gameplay experience, allowing the player to get back to the game after getting out of a sticky situation, but not making combat completely mundane by giving the player immortality. Second, Golden apples & enchanted golden apples are made unstackable. Enchanted golden apples are already rare enough to warrant single stacking. Meanwhile a stack of regular golden apples offers > 25 health bars worth of in-combat sustain to the player. That's an insane amount. This also means all healing items are brought in-line: they are all unstackable. Finally, totem of undying sources are reduced, as only 2 can be obtained from a raid, and only in hard difficulty with Bad Omen 2+. Mansions remain unchanged. This means you can't easily overflow your coffers with them, as they deserve to be an incredibly valuable item given what they do.

These changes together should help to introduce a balanced combat experience, at least in the healing department.

## Compatibility
Completely unknown. Could have issues with other mods/datapacks that change the evoker's drop table, or mods that manipulate natural regeneration. Compatibility issues will be displayed when provided/discovered (and hopefully resolved where applicable)

## Current stage?
Early development. Does not make good on its promise to unstack gaps nor alter natural burst healing. Current functionality could be reproduced by a datapack. Can clone off github though.
